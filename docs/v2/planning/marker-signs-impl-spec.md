title: "Marker Signs + WorldPin — buildable implementation spec"
status: current
purpose: "Per-feature, build-ready implementation spec for the v2 Marker Signs feature and the WorldPin substrate. Gives observable acceptance criteria, the exact vanilla decomp hooks, the feature-folder placement, and the SpecCheck manifest rows. Implementers (engineer-systems / engineer-ui) build from THIS doc; the design lock docs/design/marker-signs-worldpin.md is the why, this is the how-to-pick-it-up-cold. Authored by the architect spec-pass (card t_5fb8703d)."

# Marker Signs + WorldPin — buildable implementation spec

The design lock ([`../../design/marker-signs-worldpin.md`](../../design/marker-signs-worldpin.md))
is the *why* + the ratified architecture. This doc is the buildable *how*: one tight
section per concern an implementer can pick up cold, with the vanilla decomp hooks,
observable acceptance criteria, feature-folder placement, and SpecCheck impact.

> **Clean-side note (ADR-0001):** every vanilla decomp line cited here is the base
> game (`assembly_valheim`), which is fair game to read and adapt. Do **not** read or
> copy third-party pin mods — the design is fully grounded in vanilla primitives.
>
> **Decomp line refs:** `~/valheim/worldgen-spike/decomp/assembly_valheim.decompiled.cs`,
> re-verified by the architect 2026-06-10. They are stable anchors but **re-grep to
> confirm** before relying on an exact line (the AGENTS.md retrieve-before-claim rule).

## 0. SpecCheck manifest impact (read first — it moves with the code)

`Runtime/SpecCheck.cs` holds the recipe drift manifest. This feature adds **+4 build
piece entries** (all new, all build pieces — no item recipes):

| # | Manifest entry | Kind | Resources | Station |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `piece_sbpr_marker_poi` | build piece | Wood ×2 | (Spade menu; `m_craftingStation = null`) |
| 2 | `piece_sbpr_marker_mining` | build piece | Wood ×2 | (Spade menu; `m_craftingStation = null`) |
| 3 | `piece_sbpr_marker_shelter` | build piece | Wood ×2 | (Spade menu; `m_craftingStation = null`) |
| 4 | `piece_sbpr_marker_portal` | build piece | Wood ×2 | (Spade menu; `m_craftingStation = null`) |

- **Build cost = Wood ×2**, matching the existing Painted Sign (`SpecCheck.cs:57-59`,
  `Signs.WoodCost`). Marker signs are the same fieldcraft tier as the plain sign;
  the *map pin* is the value-add, not a costlier recipe. (If Daniel wants them
  costlier, that is a one-line manifest + recipe change — flag it, don't assume.)
- **Resource prefab-name caveat:** `Wood` is the vanilla internal id. SpecCheck flags
  a NULL `m_resItem` if the name is wrong; reuse `Signs.WoodCost` / the existing
  `BuildReq("Wood", …)` call shape (`Assets.cs:365`).
- **Manifest shape gotcha:** `SpecCheck.Run()` iterates `Manifest.Where(s => s.Piece
  != null)` for build pieces. These four are `Piece` only (`Item = null`). Match that
  shape — a `RecipeSpec` with both null or both set won't be checked
  (`cartography-impl-spec.md §0` flagged the same trap).
- The card that touches `SpecCheck.cs` first should also extend the class's
  `LOCKED SOURCE` comment to cite `docs/design/marker-signs-worldpin.md` +
  `docs/v2/planning/marker-signs-impl-spec.md` alongside the v0.1.0 source.

> **Generation tip:** the four markers are 4× repetitive — mirror the existing cairn
> pattern in `SpecCheck.cs:140-181` (it generates the per-color cairn checks in a
> `foreach` rather than enumerating). A `foreach (var m in MarkerSigns.MarkerTypes)`
> keeps the manifest DRY.

## 1. The four Marker Sign pieces — additive construction

> **STATUS (M1+M2+M3 IMPLEMENTED, card t_0c7b782d):** the four additive pieces +
> `MarkerSignTag` + spade wiring + SpecCheck +4 rows (M1), the WorldPin projection +
> derive-by-scan reconcile engine + triggers (M2, §3), and the Shift+E pin/unpin gesture
> + dedicated `MarkerSignPanel` + WearNTear destroy hook (M3, §4) are all built and
> compile 0/0. The §1.4 panel shows the marker icon (via the dedicated panel — see the
> §1.4 scope correction). **logs-green ≠ playable**: every AT closes only on Daniel's
> in-game check.

**Lands in:** `Features/MarkerSigns/MarkerSigns.cs` (registration + the type table) and
`Features/MarkerSigns/MarkerSignTag.cs` (the per-instance MonoBehaviour). New feature
folder `Features/MarkerSigns/` (mirror the vertical-slice layout of
`Features/Signs/`, `Features/Cairns/`).
**Card:** `t_<markersigns-pieces>` (engineer-systems).

### 1.1 The type table

Define the four marker types once, data-driven (so registration, SpecCheck, and the
panel all read one source — the cairn `Colors`/`MarkerName` pattern in `Cairns.cs`):

```
MarkerType { key, prefabName, niceName, pinLabel, iconFile, vanillaPinType }
  poi      → piece_sbpr_marker_poi      "Marker: Point of Interest" "Point of Interest" marker_poi_v0.1.png      Icon0
  mining   → piece_sbpr_marker_mining   "Marker: Mining"            "Mining"            marker_mining_v0.1.png   Icon0
  shelter  → piece_sbpr_marker_shelter  "Marker: Shelter"           "Shelter"          marker_shelter_v0.1.png  Icon0
  portal   → piece_sbpr_marker_portal   "Marker: Portal"            "Portal"           marker_portal_v0.1.png   Icon0
```

- `vanillaPinType` is the **base `Minimap.PinType` we pass to `AddPin`** so the pin is
  a valid, filter-toggleable vanilla pin; the **custom sprite is overridden onto
  `m_icon` after AddPin** (§3). `Icon0` is a fine neutral base for all four — the
  player never sees the base sprite because we override it every projection. (Do NOT
  reuse `Death`/`Boss`/`Player` types — those have special vanilla culling at
  `UpdatePins` :47808.)
- `iconFile` PNGs ship in `assets/icons/items/` (packer copies all `*.png` beside the
  DLL — `scripts/pack-modpack.sh:99-104`) and load via `Assets.LoadPngAsSprite`
  (`Assets.cs:14`). **First cut: these are placeholder art** (POI=magnifying glass,
  mining=pickaxe, shelter=tent, portal=circle per Q5). The art can be regenerated
  later without touching code (same filename).

### 1.2 Additive construction (ADR-0006 — hard constraint, AT-PIN-ADR0006)

**Do NOT `ClonePrefab("sign")` like the existing Painted Sign does** — that predates
ADR-0006. Build each marker piece additively:

- `new GameObject(prefabName)` parented under the inactive `PrefabHolder` (so no
  `Awake` fires during construction — `Assets.cs:42 GetHolder` pattern), then
  `AddComponent` of exactly: `Piece`, `WearNTear`, `ZNetView`, `Sign` (so the
  existing `SignInteractPatch` intercepts it and so the panel/label reuse works), and
  the custom `MarkerSignTag`.
- **Read the vanilla `sign` prefab as a BLUEPRINT only** (`ZNetScene.GetPrefab("sign")`
  fires no Awake — `Assets.cs` blueprint doctrine) for its mesh/material/`Sign`
  field values / `EffectList`s, and **reference-copy** those onto the constructed
  object. Use `vprefab inspect sign` to read the donor's real structure first.
- Set `ZNetView` fields explicitly: `m_persistent = true` (REQUIRED — the WorldPin
  durability rests on the sign's ZDO being persistent, design §3), `m_type` and
  `m_distant` per the vanilla sign blueprint. ADR-0006 confirms an `AddComponent`'d
  ZNetView with these fields set + a registered prefab name is a fully valid
  networked object (`docs/decisions/0006-additive-prefab-construction.md`).
- The visual: reuse the standing-pole + board kitbash the Painted Sign already builds
  (`Signs.cs KitbashStandingPole`), or a simpler board — the silhouette is a v0.2+
  polish call. The load-bearing requirement is a placeable, interactable sign body
  that carries a `Sign` (for the panel) + a `ZNetView` (for the ZDO).

> **🔴 DEFERRAL LIFTED (2026-06-11, card `t_69f3b4f8`).** The "silhouette is a v0.2+
> polish call" shortcut shipped a board embedded in the post and a post foot sunk into
> the ground (Daniel playtest, v0.2.19-playtest). The seat/standoff/foot geometry is now
> load-bearing and promoted to the shared correct path. **Implement per
> `docs/v2/planning/marker-signs-geometry-fix-impl-spec.md`** — crown-anchored board +
> side-face standoff + post-foot seat, with the tuning constants + math + foot-collider
> factored into `Runtime/SignGeometry.cs` so the Painted Sign and the markers can never
> drift again.

> **Why keep a `Sign` component?** The existing `SignInteractPatch` keys on
> `Sign.Interact`, and the panel + text label reuse the vanilla `Sign` text widget.
> Putting `Sign` on the marker piece lets us reuse the whole Painted-Sign interaction
> stack (panel, two-tone tint, text) for free, and only ADD the Shift+E branch (§4).

### 1.3 Registration + Spade menu wiring

- Register the four prefabs in `MarkerSigns.RegisterPrefabs(zns)` (called from
  `Registrar.OnZNetSceneAwake` — add the dispatch line after `Signs.RegisterPrefabs`,
  `Registrar.cs:62`). Each is registered into ZNetScene by name via
  `Assets.RegisterPrefabInZNetScene` (`Assets.cs:264`).
- Add the four pieces to the **Spade** PieceTable, NOT the Hammer (Pillar 1). The
  spade table is built in `Trailblazing.DoObjectDBWiring` (`Trailblazing.cs:430-435`
  adds Sign / Path Lamp / Cairns via `AddSpadePieceByName`). Add four
  `AddSpadePieceByName(zns, table, MarkerSigns.PrefabName(type))` lines there, after
  the cairns. **Race-safety:** `Registrar` runs all `RegisterPrefabs` before any
  `DoObjectDBWiring` and dispatches Trailblazing AFTER the feature modules, so the
  marker prefabs resolve by name there — same guarantee the Sign/Cairn wiring relies
  on. Every piece must be `Piece.PieceCategory.Misc` to render in the single 'Trail'
  tab (`Trailblazing.cs:423` + the `EnsureCategory` self-heal guard).
- `piece.m_craftingStation = null` (no bench to place — every Spade-placed SBPR piece
  does this: `Signs.cs:270`, `Trailhead.cs:186`).
- `MarkerSigns.DoObjectDBWiring(zns)` rebuilds `piece.m_resources = { BuildReq("Wood",
  2) }` (the ODB-phase authoritative pass, mirroring `Signs.cs:303-328`), then add the
  `MarkerSigns.DoObjectDBWiring` dispatch line to `Registrar.cs` after
  `Signs.DoObjectDBWiring` (`Registrar.cs:116`).

### 1.4 The panel-icon-for-reference (AT-MARK-1)

Daniel: "add the icon into the UI for reference." The marker's icon sprite shows in
the panel when you interact (primary E) with a marker sign, so the player sees which
marker type this is. **First cut: piece build-icon art = the marker icon art** (Daniel:
"for now, just make the piece art the icon art") — set `piece.m_icon =
LoadPngAsSprite(iconFile)`. The "icon overlaid bottom-right on the piece art" is v2.1
polish, explicitly out of scope.

> **🔴 SCOPE CORRECTION (M3 impl, card t_0c7b782d) — do NOT reuse `SignPaintPanel`.** This
> §1.4 originally said "reuse the existing `SignPaintPanel` and add a single `Image`
> element bound to `MarkerSignTag.MarkerIcon`." That premise is wrong on contact with the
> code: `SignPaintPanel.Open()` **hard-requires a `SignTag`** (`SignPaintPanel.cs:119-120`
> early-returns without one) and its entire 807-line surface is the Painted Sign's
> **pigment + text editor** (color swatches, pigment-discovery gating, `CommitPaint`) —
> none of which applies to a marker (Q1 defers per-pin color; a marker has NO paint
> colors). A marker carries `MarkerSignTag`, not `SignTag`, so routing it through
> `SignPaintPanel` silently no-ops. The implemented design is a **dedicated, self-contained
> `Features/Signs/MarkerSignPanel.cs`**: the marker icon (square reference image) + nice
> name + pin-state line + a Pin/Unpin button (same toggle as the Shift+E fast gesture,
> surfaced as a discoverable affordance) + Close. It reuses the SHARED `VanillaUISkin`
> (already factored out of the paint panel) for the native wood look and degrades to flat
> colors if the skin donor is absent — and it touches **nothing** in the shipping Painted
> Sign UI. `SignPanelInputBlock` was widened (`AnyOpen`) so the cursor/input handling
> covers both panels identically.

### 1.5 Acceptance criteria
- **AT-MARK-1** — four Marker Sign entries on the Spade 'Trail' tab; each places like
  the existing sign; interacting (primary E) shows the marker's icon in the panel.
- **AT-PIN-ADR0006** — the four pieces are constructed additively; a regression guard
  asserts no marker prefab is a runtime clone of a ZNetView-bearing prefab.
- SpecCheck rows 1–4 present; `[hold]` PR; logs-green ≠ playable.

## 2. `MarkerSignTag` — per-instance ZDO state (mirrors `SignTag`)

**Lands in:** `Features/MarkerSigns/MarkerSignTag.cs`. Mirrors the ZDO-backed
per-instance pattern of `Features/Signs/SignTag.cs` (owner-write via `ZNetView`,
re-apply on spawn).

### 2.1 ZDO fields

| ZDO key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SBPR_MarkerType` | string | the marker type key (`poi`/`mining`/`shelter`/`portal`). Usually derivable from the prefab name, but stored so a scan can read it off the ZDO without a prefab→type map. |
| `SBPR_Pinned` | bool (int 0/1) | is this marker currently pinned on the placer's map? Toggled by Shift+E. |
| `SBPR_PinName` | string | **the player's custom name for this marker (ENHANCEMENT, card t_62af5802, §7).** Empty/unset = fall back to the type's `PinLabel`. Drives the WorldPin's on-map label. Owner-write, same pattern as `SBPR_Pinned`. A new wire contract — lock it, never rename (a rename orphans the names on every placed marker). |
| `SBPR_PinIconColor` | string | **RESERVED, unused in first cut** (Q1 defers color). Empty = default. Reserve the key now so the fast-follow doesn't need a ZDO migration. |
| `SBPR_PinTextColor` | string | **RESERVED, unused in first cut.** Same. |

- Owner-write pattern: `if (!nview.IsOwner()) nview.ClaimOwnership(); nview.GetZDO()
  .Set(key, value);` — copy `SignTag.WriteColors` (`SignTag.cs:97-105`) verbatim in
  shape. Guard every read/write on `nview != null && nview.GetZDO() != null` (ghost
  has no ZDO — `SignTag.cs:66` shows the ghost gate).
- `MarkerType` is set once at placement (from the prefab the player built). `Pinned`
  defaults false (a freshly built marker sign is NOT pinned until the player presses
  Shift+E — confirm with Daniel if he'd rather auto-pin on place; the card's wording
  "Shift+E should pin or unpin" implies explicit, so default false).

> **ENHANCEMENT (card t_62af5802):** a fifth field — `SBPR_PinName` (string) — was added
> to make markers namable, driving the WorldPin's map label. Full spec in **§7**. Read it
> alongside this section: the read/write accessors mirror `ReadPinned`/`WritePinned`, and
> the label-read change lands in `WorldPins` (two sites, §7.3).

### 2.2 Lifecycle hooks on the tag

- **`Awake`** — cache `nview`, read `MarkerType`, subscribe the destroy hook (§4.2),
  and if `Pinned` is true on a client that owns/sees this zone, ensure the WorldPin is
  projected (the reconcile pass §3 is the authority; Awake just nudges it).
- **`OnDestroy` is NOT the hook** — Unity's `OnDestroy` fires on every zone unload too
  (not just true destruction), which would wrongly unpin a sign whose zone merely
  unloaded. Use `WearNTear.m_onDestroyed` instead (§4.2) — it fires only on **real**
  destruction (decay/raid/demolish), not on unload. **This distinction is
  load-bearing: getting it wrong reintroduces the exact stale/flicker bug the design
  avoids.**

## 3. The WorldPin projection + render (the substrate)

> **STATUS (M2 IMPLEMENTED, card t_0c7b782d):** the projection primitive (`AddPin
> save:false` + `m_icon` override) and the derive-by-scan reconcile engine are built in
> `Features/MarkerSigns/WorldPins.cs` and compile 0/0. Triggers
> (`Features/MarkerSigns/WorldPinReconcilePatches.cs`): `Minimap.SetMapMode` (map-open →
> full reconcile), throttled `Minimap.Update` (periodic tick), and `Minimap.Awake`
> (drops the stale projection so it rebuilds onto the new map — the AT-PIN-PERSIST guard
> on fresh client join / server restart). **MVP scope correction (v1, see §3.2):** the
> v1 build nerfs the full M-key map, so the live render target is the player-centered
> MINIMAP CIRCLE; the reconcile uses an UNBOUNDED client-side loaded-zone scan (no disc
> clip). The 1000 m disc-bound, SERVER-authoritative-RPC variant is the cartography
> viewer's job — and both cartography cards (t_38f9c77a / t_7b616020) are NOT in flight
> (archived / triage), so that path is a documented deferral. The public surface
> (`Reconcile(boundCenter, boundRadius)`, `ProjectPinnedNow`, `RemoveProjected`,
> `OnMarkerDestroyed`, `ResetForNewMap`) is the seam the viewer will consume — one pin
> model, not forked. **logs-green ≠ playable**: AT-MARK-2 / AT-PIN-PERSIST close only on
> Daniel's in-game check.

**Lands in:** `Features/MarkerSigns/WorldPins.cs` (the projection/reconcile engine) —
or, if the cartography cards land first, **this is shared code** that should live
where the cartography viewer can consume it (coordinate placement with cards
`t_38f9c77a` / `t_7b616020`; see design §5 "do not fork"). Default home:
`Features/MarkerSigns/WorldPins.cs` with a public surface the cartography viewer calls.

### 3.1 The projection primitive (render a WorldPin onto the vanilla minimap)

For each WorldPin to show:

```
var pin = Minimap.instance.AddPin(worldPos, basePinType, label, save: false, isChecked: false);
pin.m_icon = markerSprite;   // custom sprite override — STABLE per design §V1
```

- **`save: false` is mandatory** (`AddPin` signature :48466). It keeps vanilla from
  ever persisting our pin to the player profile — which is what makes AT-PIN-PERSIST
  and AT-PIN-DESTROY-DURABLE pass by construction (nothing of ours is stored
  client-side, so nothing stale can survive).
- **The `m_icon` override is stable** — `UpdatePins` (:47786) only reads `pin.m_icon`
  when it (re)creates the marker GameObject (`pin.m_uiElement == null` branch :47812 →
  :47816), and does NOT re-derive it from the type. So set it once after AddPin; no
  per-rebuild re-skin postfix needed for the icon (design §V1 — this is the
  correction to the originating card's framing).
- Keep a client-local map `{signZDOID → projected PinData}` so reconcile can diff
  (which pins to add, which to `RemovePin`). This map is **transient** (rebuilt from
  the live set each reconcile); it is NOT persisted.

### 3.2 The reconcile pass (derive-by-scan — design §4.2)

On each reconcile trigger (§3.3), rebuild the visible WorldPin set from the **live**
marker-sign ZDOs and diff against the client-local projected map:

- **Source of truth = live ZDOs.** Enumerate marker-sign ZDOs via
  `ZDOMan.instance.GetAllZDOsWithPrefabIterative(prefabName, list, ref index)`
  (:65497) for each of the four marker prefabs — call it iteratively until it returns
  `true` (it batches 400 sectors/call; vanilla drives it the same way at :37512). On
  a **dedicated server** this enumerates the complete persistent set (design §3); a
  **client** sees its loaded zones, so for the field-disc projection the client should
  ask the **server** for the authoritative set inside the bound disc (a small routed
  RPC, or piggyback on the cartography Table's existing data channel — coordinate
  with `t_38f9c77a`). For a **local/singleplayer** host, client == server and the scan
  is authoritative directly.
- For each live ZDO read: `pos = zdo.GetPosition()` (:62297), `markerType` (from
  `SBPR_MarkerType` or the prefab), `pinned = zdo.GetBool(SBPR_Pinned)`. Project only
  the ones with `pinned == true` AND inside the bound 1000 m disc (design §4.3 / the
  cartography 1000 m bound).
- **Diff:** add pins newly present, `Minimap.RemovePin(PinData)` (:48408) pins whose
  signZDOID is no longer in the live set (the stale-pin drop — this is where a
  destroyed/offline sign's pin disappears, AT-PIN-DESTROY-DURABLE).
- **Stale-free by construction:** a destroyed sign's ZDO is gone from `m_objectsByID`
  (:65051) so it never appears in the scan — there is no dangling reference to clean
  up (design §4.2).

### 3.3 Reconcile triggers (design §4.4)

- **Map open** — full reconcile (load-bearing; the returning-offline-owner case).
  Hook the minimap mode change / map-open (the cartography viewer card owns the exact
  hook; for the standalone Marker-Sign MVP, a `Minimap.SetMapMode` postfix or the
  viewer's open event).
- **Light periodic tick while the map is open** — catch other clients' Shift+E /
  destroy without reopening (a few seconds; playtest-tuned).
- **Login / zone-enter** — opportunistic refresh.

### 3.4 Acceptance criteria
- **AT-MARK-2** — Shift+E adds a pin with the marker's CUSTOM sprite (not a stock
  vanilla pin); Shift+E again removes it; hover/legend reads the marker type.
- **AT-PIN-PERSIST** — the custom icon survives map close/reopen, server restart, and
  fresh client join (never reverts to a stock pin) — because each is a re-skinned
  `save:false` projection, never a persisted vanilla pin.
- `[hold]` PR; logs-green ≠ playable.

## 4. Shift+E gesture + destroy hook (the wiring)

> **STATUS (M3 IMPLEMENTED, card t_0c7b782d):** `SignInteractPatch` now branches on the
> tag — a `MarkerSignTag` with `alt==true` (Shift+E) toggles `SBPR_Pinned` (owner-write)
> and projects/removes the WorldPin via the fast path; `alt==false` opens the dedicated
> `MarkerSignPanel` (§1.4 correction below). The destroy hook is the `MarkerSignTag`'s
> `WearNTear.m_onDestroyed` subscription calling `WorldPins.OnMarkerDestroyed` (public
> Action, NO Harmony patch; NOT Unity OnDestroy). `SignPanelInputBlock` was widened to
> gate on EITHER panel (`AnyOpen`). Build 0/0. **logs-green ≠ playable**:
> AT-PIN-DESTROY-LOADED / AT-PIN-DESTROY-DURABLE close only on Daniel's in-game check.

### 4.1 Wire Shift+E into the existing `SignInteractPatch`

The existing prefix `Features/Signs/SignInteractPatch.cs` already intercepts
`Sign.Interact` for SBPR signs. Extend it (or add a sibling marker-specific patch —
implementer's call; extending is fewer moving parts) so:

- `hold == true` → fall through to vanilla (existing behavior, `SignInteractPatch.cs:31`).
- `alt == false` (primary E) → open the paint/text panel (existing behavior). For a
  marker sign the panel ALSO shows the marker icon (§1.4).
- **`alt == true` (Shift+E)** → **NEW**: if the sign carries a `MarkerSignTag`, toggle
  its `SBPR_Pinned` ZDO bool (owner-write) and immediately project/`RemovePin` the
  WorldPin locally (the fast path). Set `__result = true; return false;` to consume
  the interaction. If the sign is a plain Painted Sign (no `MarkerSignTag`), Shift+E
  falls through to vanilla (the plain sign has no pin gesture).
- **Grounding:** `alt` is the AltPlace/Shift key fed through `Player.Interact`
  (`ZInput.GetButton("AltPlace")` → `alt` :16115 → `Interact(go, hold, alt)` :19270 →
  `componentInParent.Interact(this, hold, alt)` :19280). No new input code.

> The current patch comment (`SignInteractPatch.cs:22`) says the Shift+E gesture is
> intentionally not wired — **update that comment** when wiring it, and update
> `requirements.md:603` (the spec-and-code-together rule: the deferred-gesture note
> becomes a done note).

### 4.2 The destroy hook — subscribe to `WearNTear.m_onDestroyed`

In `MarkerSignTag.Awake` (or a small dedicated component), subscribe to the sign's
`WearNTear.m_onDestroyed`:

```
var wnt = GetComponent<WearNTear>();
if (wnt != null) wnt.m_onDestroyed += OnSignDestroyed;
```

- `m_onDestroyed` is a **public `Action` field** on `WearNTear` (:128027), invoked
  **owner-side inside `WearNTear.Destroy()`** (:129051), which is reached only on real
  destruction (`RPC_Remove` → `if (m_nview.IsOwner()) Destroy()` :129025-129031, and
  the decay/hit paths). **It is a public subscribe seam — NO Harmony patch needed.**
- `OnSignDestroyed` clears the WorldPin for this signZDOID locally (fast path) and,
  for any client that has the zone loaded, the projected pin drops. The durable
  offline case is handled by the reconcile (§3.2) — this hook is just the prompt
  online path (AT-PIN-DESTROY-LOADED).
- **Do NOT use Unity `OnDestroy`** for unpin — it fires on zone unload too (§2.2),
  which would unpin a merely-unloaded sign. `m_onDestroyed` fires only on real
  destruction. This is the single most important wiring detail in the feature.
- Unsubscribe in `OnDestroy` to avoid a dangling delegate on the pooled component.

### 4.3 Acceptance criteria
- **AT-PIN-DESTROY-LOADED** — destroy a pinned marker sign in a loaded zone → its pin
  is gone promptly (the `m_onDestroyed` fast path).
- **AT-PIN-DESTROY-DURABLE** — destroy a pinned marker sign while its zone is unloaded
  for the owner / the owner is offline (decay/raid) → no stale pin; gone on the
  owner's next map open (the reconcile §3.2 backstop). **The load-bearing test.**

## 4A. State-aware hover hint — "[Shift+E] Pin/Unpin" (card t_7816c0b0)

> **STATUS: SPEC, not yet implemented.** The Shift+E gesture (§4.1) shipped and works,
> but it is **invisible in-world** — a placed marker sign shows only the vanilla `Sign`
> hover text (its typed text + the primary `[Use]` line), giving no hint that Shift+E
> pins/unpins it and no indication of the current pin state. Daniel, v0.2.19-playtest:
> *"sign posts should have hint text when looked at that state Shift + E to pin/unpin
> depending on the tracked state."* This section specs the missing **hover-text surface
> only**; the gesture, the `SBPR_Pinned` ZDO, and `ReadPinned()` already exist.

### 4A.1 Why the marker falls through to vanilla `Sign.GetHoverText` (root cause, decomp-grounded)

The crosshair hover text is produced by exactly **one** `Hoverable`, resolved like this:

- `Hud.UpdateCrosshair` (decomp `assembly_valheim.decompiled.cs:39688`) does
  `Hoverable hoverable = hoverObject.GetComponentInParent<Hoverable>();` (`:39699`) then
  `string text = hoverable.GetHoverText();` (`:39702`). `GetComponentInParent<Hoverable>()`
  returns the **first** `Hoverable` found walking up from the hovered collider — a single
  component, not all of them.
- The hovered GameObject is set by `Player.FindHoverObject` (`:19230`), which picks the
  object whose collider (or its parent) carries a `Hoverable` (`:19253`).
- **`Sign` itself implements `Hoverable`:** `public class Sign : MonoBehaviour, Hoverable,
  Interactable, TextReceiver` (`:121412`). On a marker sign the `Sign` component is added
  **before** `MarkerSignTag` (`MarkerSigns.cs`: `AddComponent<Sign>()` at :176, then
  `AddComponent<MarkerSignTag>()` at :222), so `Sign` is the `Hoverable` that wins the
  query. The bug report — "shows only the vanilla Sign hover text" — is **empirical proof**
  that `Sign.GetHoverText` is the method firing on a marker.

Vanilla `Sign.GetHoverText` (`:121447`) returns, when the player has ward access:

```
"<typed sign text>"
<m_name>
[<color=yellow><b>$KEY_Use</b></color>] $piece_use
```

…and when ward access is denied, it **returns early** with just the quoted text (no
`[Use]` line). So a marker already shows the primary-`[Use]` hint for free (this is what
**AT-MARKER-HINT-4** asserts — keep it; do not duplicate it). The only thing missing is a
`[Shift+E] Pin/Unpin` line whose wording flips with `ReadPinned()`.

### 4A.2 Decision — ROUTE (a): Harmony **postfix** on `Sign.GetHoverText`, markers-only

The card floated two routes. They are **not** equivalent; the engine settles it:

- **Route (a) — postfix `Sign.GetHoverText` (CHOSEN).** Augments the exact method already
  proven to fire on a marker (§4A.1). Markers-only: the postfix early-returns unless the
  `Sign` carries a `MarkerSignTag`, identical to how `SignInteractPatch` keys on the tag.
  Consistent with the established "augment vanilla `Sign` for markers only" pattern.
- **Route (b) — `MarkerSignTag : Hoverable` (REJECTED).** Adding a *second* `Hoverable` to
  the marker does **not** reliably win the crosshair query: `GetComponentInParent<Hoverable>()`
  (`:39699`) returns only one component, and the vanilla `Sign` is added first, so `Sign`
  keeps winning. To make route (b) work you'd have to *displace* or suppress the `Sign`'s
  Hoverable — fighting Unity component order for no benefit. Route (a) is strictly simpler
  and lands on the surface that already works.

### 4A.3 The patch shape

New file `Features/Signs/SignHoverTextPatch.cs` (sibling to `SignInteractPatch.cs`):

```csharp
[HarmonyPatch(typeof(Sign), nameof(Sign.GetHoverText))]
public static class SignHoverTextPatch
{
    [HarmonyPostfix]
    private static void Postfix(Sign __instance, ref string __result)
    {
        // Markers-only: a plain Painted Sign (SignTag, no MarkerSignTag) is untouched.
        var marker = __instance.GetComponent<MarkerSignTag>();
        if (marker == null) return;

        // Ward-denied vanilla path returned early with no [Use] line; don't bolt a
        // pin affordance onto a sign the player can't act on. Mirror the same gate
        // vanilla uses (Sign.GetHoverText :121450, PrivateArea.CheckAccess flash:false).
        if (!PrivateArea.CheckAccess(__instance.transform.position, 0f, flash: false))
            return;

        // ReadPinned() is false on a ghost / no-ZDO instance (MarkerSignTag.cs:121-124),
        // so a not-yet-placed marker simply reads "Pin to map" — no NRE, no special case.
        bool pinned = marker.ReadPinned();
        string verb = pinned ? "Unpin from map" : "Pin to map";

        // Append a Shift+<use> line. Mirror CairnInteractable.cs:56's shipped precedent
        // for the alt-interact modifier hint (literal "Shift" + the bound $KEY_Use token),
        // then localize so $KEY_Use renders the player's actual bound use key.
        string line = $"\n[<color=yellow><b>Shift+$KEY_Use</b></color>] {verb}";
        __result += Localization.instance != null
            ? Localization.instance.Localize(line)
            : line;
    }
}
```

Notes the implementer MUST honor:

- **Markers-only (AT-MARKER-HINT-5):** key on `GetComponent<MarkerSignTag>() != null`, exactly
  like `SignInteractPatch.cs:44`. A plain Painted Sign carries `SignTag`, not `MarkerSignTag`,
  so it never gets the pin line. **Add a regression assertion** in the markers-only test that a
  `SignTag`-only sign's hover text contains no "Pin"/"Unpin" substring.
- **Append, never replace (AT-MARKER-HINT-4):** `__result += …`. The vanilla typed-text line and
  the `[Use] $piece_use` line stay intact above the new pin line.
- **Live state (AT-MARKER-HINT-3):** `GetHoverText()` is called every crosshair frame
  (`Hud.UpdateCrosshair`), and `ReadPinned()` reads the ZDO live — so the wording flips on the
  very next hover frame after a Shift+E toggle with **zero** extra plumbing. No caching; no
  look-away-and-back.
- **No-ZDO / ghost path (open-question resolution):** `ReadPinned()` returns `false` on the ghost
  (no ZDO — `MarkerSignTag.cs:123`). The ghost has no `Sign.GetHoverText` crosshair query anyway
  (it's a placement preview, not a hovered world object), but even if hit, it reads "Pin to map"
  with no exception. **Confirmed: no NRE path.**

### 4A.4 Hint wording + key-token correctness (AT-MARKER-HINT-6 — resolved)

- **Verb wording (LOCKED):** un-pinned → **"Pin to map"**; pinned → **"Unpin from map"**. This
  matches the panel's own button labels for consistency (`MarkerSignPanel.cs:262`:
  `"Unpin"`/`"Pin"`; state line `"Pinned on your map"`/`"Not pinned"` at :260). The hover line is
  the terse form; the panel is the verbose form. Don't invent a third phrasing.
- **The use key IS tokenized:** `$KEY_Use` localizes to the player's bound use key (verified:
  vanilla `Sign.GetHoverText` itself emits `$KEY_Use`, `:121456`; the repo localizes it on the way
  out, `CairnInteractable.cs:58-65`). So rebinding "Use" is handled correctly.
- **The modifier — recommended vs. accepted simplification:**
  - There is **no `$KEY_AltPlace` localization token** in vanilla (verified: a `strings` +
    decomp scan finds only the private `m_altPlace` field at `:15447`, never a `$KEY_AltPlace`
    string). So you cannot tokenize the modifier the way you tokenize `$KEY_Use`.
  - **True rebind-correctness IS available** via `ZInput.instance.GetBoundKeyString("AltPlace")`
    (vanilla uses this exact API for on-screen key hints, `:39338` / `:135144`). The gesture's
    modifier is `ZInput.GetButton("AltPlace")` (`:16115`), so `GetBoundKeyString("AltPlace")`
    yields the player's actual bound modifier string.
  - **ACCEPTED SIMPLIFICATION (default):** ship the literal **"Shift"** — this is the **shipped
    repo precedent**: `CairnInteractable.cs:56` already shows `[Shift+$KEY_Use]` as a literal for
    the cairn's own alt-interact debug affordance. Matching it keeps the two SBPR alt-interact
    hints visually identical and avoids a per-frame `GetBoundKeyString` call in the hover hot path.
  - **Implementer's call, documented either way:** prefer the literal "Shift" to match
    `CairnInteractable` (simpler, consistent); upgrade to `GetBoundKeyString("AltPlace")` only if
    Daniel wants true rebind-correctness in a later polish pass. Either choice satisfies
    AT-MARKER-HINT-6 because the simplification is now documented here. **Do not silently hardcode
    "E"** — always tokenize the use key via `$KEY_Use`.

### 4A.5 Acceptance criteria (refined from the card)

- **AT-MARKER-HINT-1** — hovering an UN-pinned marker sign shows a pin hint:
  `[Shift+E] Pin to map` (use key localized to the player's bound key).
- **AT-MARKER-HINT-2** — hovering a PINNED marker sign shows `[Shift+E] Unpin from map` — the
  verb flips with the tracked `SBPR_Pinned` state (`ReadPinned()`).
- **AT-MARKER-HINT-3** — after a Shift+E toggle, the hint reflects the new state on the next
  hover frame, without looking away and back (free, because `GetHoverText` is per-frame and
  `ReadPinned` is live).
- **AT-MARKER-HINT-4** — the vanilla primary `[Use] $piece_use` hint (open/edit the panel) and the
  typed sign text remain present above the pin line (the postfix appends, never replaces).
- **AT-MARKER-HINT-5 (markers-only)** — a plain Painted Sign (SignTag, no MarkerSignTag) shows NO
  Shift+E pin hint. Regression-assert the hover string contains no "Pin"/"Unpin".
- **AT-MARKER-HINT-6 (key correctness)** — the use key is tokenized (`$KEY_Use`); the "Shift"
  modifier is either `GetBoundKeyString("AltPlace")` (true) or the documented literal "Shift"
  matching `CairnInteractable.cs:56` (accepted simplification). Never a hardcoded "E".
- **AT-MARKER-HINT-WARD** *(added)* — when the player lacks ward access (vanilla `Sign.GetHoverText`
  returns early with text only), the postfix appends **nothing** — no pin affordance is offered on
  a sign the player can't toggle. (Mirrors the vanilla ward gate; the gesture itself is
  ward/owner-gated by `WritePinned`'s ownership claim anyway.)
- **logs-green ≠ playable** — closes only on Daniel confirming in-game that the hover hint appears
  and flips with pin state.

### 4A.6 SpecCheck / scope

- **SpecCheck impact: NONE.** Hover text is not a recipe or piece-count row; the
  `Runtime/SpecCheck.cs` manifest is untouched. **No new ZDO field** — reads the existing
  `SBPR_Pinned` via `ReadPinned()`. No prefab/registration change.
- **In scope:** the state-aware hover-hint text on placed marker signs, markers-only.
- **Out of scope:** the Shift+E gesture (§4.1, already works); the `MarkerSignPanel` (card
  t_62af5802); geometry (t_69f3b4f8); the recipe tier (t_d5dcb044); Painted-Sign hover text; the
  Surveyor's Table / Local Map hover surfaces.

## 5. Build order, cross-feature seams, and the SpecCheck rule

- **Build order (lowest → highest risk):**
  1. The four pieces + `MarkerSignTag` + Spade wiring + SpecCheck rows (§1–§2) — a
     self-contained "buildable, interactable marker signs" milestone, testable
     before any pin code (AT-MARK-1, AT-PIN-ADR0006).
  2. The WorldPin projection + reconcile engine (§3) — the substrate.
  3. The Shift+E gesture + destroy hook (§4) — wires (1) and (2) together
     (AT-MARK-2, AT-PIN-DESTROY-*).
- **The WorldPin engine (§3) is the seam shared with the v2 cartography viewer**
  (`cartography-impl-spec.md §2B`, cards `t_38f9c77a` / `t_7b616020`). **One pin
  model, built once** (design §5). If a cartography card is in flight, coordinate the
  home of `WorldPins.cs` so the Local Map viewer and the Surveyor's Table consume the
  same projection/reconcile surface rather than forking a second pin notion. The
  Surveyor's Table's "pin removal" (cartography D4) operates on this same WorldPin
  set.
- **All clean-side / ADR-0006:** additive construction, vanilla read as blueprint, no
  third-party pin-mod source read, no decompiled IronGate source committed.
- **Spec-first:** each impl card moves its `SpecCheck.cs` manifest rows + its code +
  the relevant spec cross-check in the same PR. A card is done when code, spec, and
  the SpecCheck manifest agree — and (logs-green ≠ playable) only when Daniel verifies
  it in-game.

## 6. Naming reference (prefab / ZDO-key strings — agree before building)

| Thing | Name (lock in the first PR that registers it) | Type |
|---|---|---|
| POI marker | `piece_sbpr_marker_poi` | build piece |
| Mining marker | `piece_sbpr_marker_mining` | build piece |
| Shelter marker | `piece_sbpr_marker_shelter` | build piece |
| Portal marker | `piece_sbpr_marker_portal` | build piece |
| Marker-type ZDO field | `SBPR_MarkerType` | ZDO string |
| Pinned-state ZDO field | `SBPR_Pinned` | ZDO bool |
| Pin custom-name ZDO field | `SBPR_PinName` | ZDO string (custom label; §7) |
| Pin icon-color (reserved) | `SBPR_PinIconColor` | ZDO string (unused first cut) |
| Pin text-color (reserved) | `SBPR_PinTextColor` | ZDO string (unused first cut) |
| Marker sprites | `assets/icons/items/marker_{poi,mining,shelter,portal}_v0.1.png` | PNG |

> Prefab-name + ZDO-key strings are **save/wire contracts** the moment a piece is
> placed in a live world. Lock them in the first impl PR and never rename
> (renaming orphans every placed instance — the same reason `Pigments` kept
> `SBPR_Ink*`). The `_v0.1` suffix on sprite filenames matches the existing

## 7. ENHANCEMENT: namable markers → custom WorldPin label (card t_62af5802)

> **STATUS: SPEC-LOCKED, NOT YET BUILT** (architect spec-pass, card t_62af5802,
> 2026-06-11). Routed to `engineer-systems`. This section ADDS a feature the M1–M3
> build intentionally omitted: the marker shipped read-only with a STATIC per-type
> pin label. Daniel's 2026-06-11 v0.2.19-playtest ask: *"the new marker signs should
> be namable via a textbox, and that textbox should map to the name of the pin.
> (dynamically ideally)."* Three pieces wire together — a textbox in the panel, a
> `SBPR_PinName` ZDO field, and a label-read + re-project in `WorldPins`.

### 7.1 Decision A — UI route: self-contained `InputField` in `MarkerSignPanel`

**LOCKED: route (a) — add a uGUI `InputField` directly to `MarkerSignPanel`.** NOT
route (b) (reuse the vanilla `Sign` text-edit path / the Painted Sign machinery).
Rationale, grounded in the code:

- **The marker name is NOT the sign's board text.** They are two distinct strings
  with two distinct destinations: the board text (vanilla `Sign.GetText`/`SetText`,
  ZDO key `text`) is what's painted on the plank in the world; the *pin name* is the
  map-label. Conflating them (route b) would make the in-world plank and the map pin
  always show the same string — which Daniel did not ask for and which forecloses
  ever showing a short pin label with longer board prose (or vice-versa). Keep them
  orthogonal: a dedicated `SBPR_PinName` field, edited in our own panel.
- **`MarkerSignPanel` already owns the interact surface** (`SignInteractPatch.cs:79`
  routes primary-E to it) and **already has the input plumbing**: `SignPanelInputBlock`
  gates on `MarkerSignPanel.IsOpen` (`SignPanelInputBlock.cs:43`), so character/camera
  input is blocked and the cursor is freed while the panel is open — an `InputField`
  there is clickable and typeable for free, no new patches.
- **The `InputField` recipe already exists**, proven, in `SignPaintPanel.MakeInputField`
  (`SignPaintPanel.cs:685-743`): a skinned `Image` background (VanillaUISkin frame
  sprite + flat fallback), a text component, a placeholder, `input.characterLimit`,
  `lineType`. The implementer adapts that helper into `MarkerSignPanel` (the marker
  panel keeps its own small UI-primitive helpers per its `:265` doc note — copy the
  `MakeInputField` shape rather than cross-referencing the paint panel's private one).
- Route (b)'s only claimed advantage was "reuses proven text-commit + ZDO-write code."
  But the marker's commit target is a NEW ZDO key (`SBPR_PinName`), not the vanilla
  `Sign` text — so route (b) reuses *less* than it appears (we'd still write our own
  ZDO field) while *coupling* the pin name to the board text. Route (a) is the cleaner
  separation and the marker panel is the natural home.

### 7.2 Decision B — persistence: `SBPR_PinName` owner-write, mirrors `ReadPinned`/`WritePinned`

Add to `MarkerSignTag` (`Features/MarkerSigns/MarkerSignTag.cs`), copying the EXACT
owner-write shape of `ReadPinned`/`WritePinned` (`:120-138`):

```csharp
/// <summary>Current custom pin name from the ZDO ("" on the ghost / no ZDO / unset).</summary>
public string ReadPinName()
{
    if (nview == null || nview.GetZDO() == null) return "";
    return nview.GetZDO().GetString(MarkerSigns.ZdoPinName, "");
}

/// <summary>Owner-write the custom pin name (already trimmed/capped by the caller).
/// Returns false if the ZDO isn't ready (ghost). Mirrors WritePinned's owner-claim.</summary>
public bool WritePinName(string name)
{
    if (nview == null || nview.GetZDO() == null) return false;
    if (!nview.IsOwner()) nview.ClaimOwnership();
    nview.GetZDO().Set(MarkerSigns.ZdoPinName, name ?? "");
    return true;
}
```

- Add the constant in `MarkerSigns.cs` next to the others (`:34-37`):
  `public const string ZdoPinName = "SBPR_PinName"; // string: player's custom pin label`
  and extend the `MarkerSignTag` `:11-21` ZDO-field doc block to list it as a LOCKED
  wire contract (never rename). **This is the AT-MARKER-NAME-6 contract.**
- Empty string is the canonical "unset" sentinel (matches `GetString(..., "")`), so an
  existing placed marker that never wrote a name reads `""` cleanly — no NRE, no
  orphan, the fallback (§7.4) takes over (AT-MARKER-NAME-5/6).

### 7.3 Decision C — the label read (TWO sites, not one) + the fallback

The card body flagged ONE label-derivation site (`ProjectPin` :284). **There are TWO,
and both must change** or the cartography viewer will show a different label than the
minimap:

1. **`WorldPins.ProjectPin`** (`WorldPins.cs:284`):
   `string label = def != null ? def.PinLabel : "Marker";`
2. **`WorldPins.CollectInDiscPins`** (`WorldPins.cs:259`) — the cartography-viewer
   collector, identical static-label line.

Both must prefer the per-instance name with a type-label fallback. Because the
reconcile/collect paths read raw ZDOs (no live `MarkerSignTag` in hand), read the
field straight off the ZDO there:

```csharp
string custom = zdo.GetString(MarkerSigns.ZdoPinName, "");
string label  = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(custom)
                ? custom
                : (def != null ? def.PinLabel : "Marker");
```

`ProjectPin` is also called from the fast path `ProjectPinnedNow(tag)` (`:150`), which
HAS the live tag — pass the resolved name through (e.g. add an optional
`string? overrideLabel = null` param to `ProjectPin`, computed by the caller from
`tag.ReadPinName()`), so the fast path and the scan path agree. **Centralize the
fallback in one helper** (e.g. `ResolveLabel(string custom, MarkerType? def)`) so the
two sites can't drift. This satisfies AT-MARKER-NAME-3 and AT-MARKER-NAME-5.

### 7.4 Decision D — "dynamically ideally": the corrected re-projection model

> **🔴 ARCHITECT CORRECTION — the card body's dynamic premise is WRONG against the
> code, and it's load-bearing.** The card says *"once the name lives in the ZDO, the
> NEXT reconcile pass picks it up automatically."* **It does not.** `WorldPins.Reconcile`
> only ADDS pins that aren't already projected (`if (!Projected.ContainsKey(id))`,
> `:106`) and REMOVES pins whose sign is gone. It **never updates an already-projected
> pin's label** — the comment at `:103-105` ("Already projected? Leave it") is explicit.
> And `Projected` only clears on `Minimap.Awake → ResetForNewMap` (relog / world
> reload), NOT on a map close/open. So if we only write the ZDO and wait for reconcile,
> a renamed pin's label would update **only after a relog** — exactly what
> AT-MARKER-NAME-4 forbids. The dynamic update MUST be an explicit re-projection on
> commit.

**Locked trigger model** (defines AT-MARKER-NAME-4):

- **Commit point = text-commit, not per-keystroke.** Per-keystroke ZDO writes fight the
  scan-based model and spam owner-claims; live-on-keystroke is explicitly overkill (the
  card's own open question agrees). Commit on: `InputField.onEndEdit` (focus loss / Enter),
  the panel's existing Close button, and Escape-to-close. One write per commit.
- **On commit, in `MarkerSignPanel`:**
  1. Read the field, trim + cap (§7.5). If unchanged from `_tag.ReadPinName()`, no-op.
  2. `_tag.WritePinName(name)` (owner-write ZDO).
  3. **Re-project NOW if pinned** so the label refreshes live without a relog:
     ```
     if (_tag.ReadPinned())
     {
         WorldPins.RemoveProjected(_tag.GetZdoId());  // drop the stale-label pin
         WorldPins.ProjectPinnedNow(_tag);            // re-add with the new label
     }
     ```
     `RemoveProjected` then `ProjectPinnedNow` is the minimal "update an existing pin"
     primitive given the current add/remove-only projection map — it's idempotent and
     already CLIENT-ONLY (no-ops without a Minimap). If the marker is NOT pinned, just
     persist the name; it will be used when the player next pins it.
- **Floor vs stretch (both satisfied by the above):** the AT floor is "live on map-open";
  the stretch is "live immediately." The explicit re-project on commit delivers the
  **stretch** for the editing client (the pin label changes the instant you commit, map
  open or not). The periodic `Minimap.Update` reconcile tick (3 s, `WorldPinReconcilePatches.cs:35`)
  and map-open reconcile do NOT relabel existing pins, so OTHER clients (multiplayer) see
  the new label on their next *fresh* projection of that sign — i.e. after their `Projected`
  entry is dropped (relog / they unpin-repin / the sign leaves+re-enters their scan). That
  multiplayer-propagation gap is **acceptable and out of scope** for this card (markers are
  primarily the placer's own pins; cross-client label sync rides the same deferred
  server-authoritative-scan path as the rest of the WorldPin multiplayer story, design §4.2).
  Document it; don't try to solve it here.

> **Optional polish (implementer's call, not required):** if you want the periodic tick
> to also relabel existing pins cheaply, `Reconcile` could compare the live ZDO's
> `SBPR_PinName` against the projected `PinData.m_name` and re-project on mismatch. This
> closes the multiplayer-propagation gap for the price of one string compare per pinned
> sign per tick. **Not required for any AT here** — ship the commit-time re-projection
> first; flag this as a follow-up only if Daniel wants live cross-client relabel.

### 7.5 Decision E — length cap + sanitization

- **Cap: 32 characters.** Vanilla map pin labels are short; the WorldPin label renders
  on the minimap where a long string overflows. 32 is generous for "North iron node",
  "Daniel's base", etc. Enforce BOTH on the `InputField` (`input.characterLimit = 32`)
  AND at commit (`name = name.Trim(); if (name.Length > 32) name = name.Substring(0, 32);`)
  so a programmatic or pasted over-long value can't bypass the field cap.
- **Single-line.** `input.lineType = InputField.LineType.SingleLine` (a pin label is one
  line — unlike the paint panel's multiline board text). Enter commits (fires `onEndEdit`).
- **Trim leading/trailing whitespace** at commit. An all-whitespace name trims to `""`
  → treated as unset → falls back to the type label (AT-MARKER-NAME-5). No other
  sanitization needed: the string flows to `Minimap.AddPin`'s `name` (a plain label,
  same path vanilla uses for user-typed pin names), so there's no injection surface.
- Placeholder text in the empty field: the type's `PinLabel` (e.g. "Point of Interest")
  so the player sees what the default will be if they leave it blank.

### 7.6 Acceptance criteria (refines the card's AT-MARKER-NAME-1…6)

- **AT-MARKER-NAME-1** — the marker panel shows an editable textbox; typing a name and
  closing/reopening the panel shows the same name (ZDO-persisted).
- **AT-MARKER-NAME-2** — the custom name survives a server restart / relog (owner-write
  ZDO, same durability as `SBPR_Pinned`).
- **AT-MARKER-NAME-3** — a pinned marker's WorldPin label on the map shows the custom
  name, not the static type label (BOTH `ProjectPin` and `CollectInDiscPins` updated).
- **AT-MARKER-NAME-4 (dynamic)** — editing the name and committing (Enter / focus-loss /
  Close) updates the pin label **without a relog** for the editing client, via the
  explicit `RemoveProjected` + `ProjectPinnedNow` re-projection (§7.4). ("Live on
  map-open" floor is exceeded; "live immediately" stretch is met for the local client.)
- **AT-MARKER-NAME-5 (fallback)** — an un-named (or whitespace-only) marker shows the
  type's `PinLabel`, never an empty pin label.
- **AT-MARKER-NAME-6 (ZDO contract)** — `SBPR_PinName` is documented as a locked wire
  field (no rename); an existing placed marker with no name written reads the fallback
  cleanly (no orphan / NRE).
- **SpecCheck impact: NONE.** `SBPR_PinName` is a ZDO wire field, not a recipe row. The
  +4 build-piece manifest entries (§0) are unchanged — adding a string ZDO key does not
  touch `SpecCheck.cs`. (Document the key in the `MarkerSignTag` field-contract comment
  so it's never renamed; that's the only code-comment obligation.)
- **logs-green ≠ playable** — closes only when Daniel types a name in-game and sees it on
  the map pin.

| Dataset | `docs/datasets/PIECES_AND_CRAFTABLES.md` | marker `Function` + `ZDO fields` rows note the namable field |

Per AGENTS.md the implementer moves the code AND these spec rows in the SAME PR. No
`SpecCheck.cs` change (no recipe impact). The reserved color fields
(`SBPR_PinIconColor`/`SBPR_PinTextColor`) remain out of scope — do NOT fold the pin
icon/color "more pin art" `/queue` item into this card.
